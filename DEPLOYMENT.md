# Netflix GPT - Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deployment Configuration
- ✅ Fixed `vercel.json` with proper build configuration
- ✅ Cleaned up conflicting Firebase build artifacts
- ✅ Ensured correct output directory (`dist`) for Vercel

### 2. Security Headers
- ✅ Added comprehensive security headers to prevent "dangerous site" warnings:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer Policy

### 3. Favicon Security Issue
- ✅ Replaced external favicon URL with local `/favicon.svg`
- ✅ This eliminates the "dangerous site" warning caused by external resource loading

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically use the `vercel.json` configuration
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

3. **Verification**:
   - Check that the site loads without security warnings
   - Verify favicon loads correctly
   - Test security headers using tools like securityheaders.com

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all API keys and sensitive data are stored as Vercel environment variables
2. **Domain Security**: Consider adding your custom domain to improve security reputation
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure the site is served over HTTPS (Vercel provides this by default)

## Files Modified

- `vercel.json` - Added security headers and proper configuration
- `index.html` - Updated favicon to use local asset and added meta tags
- `.gitignore` - Added build directory to prevent conflicts
- `public/favicon.svg` - Added local favicon file
- `public/robots.txt` - Added for better SEO

## Notes

- The project has some ESLint warnings/errors that are pre-existing code quality issues
- These don't affect deployment but should be addressed for code quality
- The build process works correctly despite the lint issues
