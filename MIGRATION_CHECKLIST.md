## When Migration is Needed

### Pre-Migration Assessment ⏳
- [ ] Interview simulator code has been added to netflix-gpt repository
- [ ] All interview-related files have been identified
- [ ] Dependencies between projects have been documented
- [ ] Shared utilities have been catalogued

### New Repository Setup ⏳
- [ ] Create new repository named `job-interview-simulator` or `ai-interview-coach`
- [ ] Set up repository with proper description and topics
- [ ] Initialize with template structure from `JOB_INTERVIEW_SIMULATOR_TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Configure repository settings and branch protection

### Code Migration Process ⏳
- [ ] **Step 1**: Copy interview-related files using git subtree or manual copy
- [ ] **Step 2**: Update all import paths and references
- [ ] **Step 3**: Configure package.json and pom.xml with new names
- [ ] **Step 4**: Set up environment variables using templates
- [ ] **Step 5**: Update API endpoints and CORS settings
- [ ] **Step 6**: Configure database connections for new project

### Configuration Updates ⏳
- [ ] **Frontend**: Update package.json name and dependencies
- [ ] **Backend**: Update Spring Boot application properties
- [ ] **Database**: Set up separate MongoDB instance/database
- [ ] **Authentication**: Configure JWT and security settings
- [ ] **Storage**: Set up AWS S3 or cloud storage
- [ ] **APIs**: Configure emotion recognition and other AI services

### Testing and Validation ⏳
- [ ] **Build Tests**: Ensure both frontend and backend build successfully
- [ ] **Functionality Tests**: Verify all features work independently
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test API connections and data flow
- [ ] **Authentication Tests**: Verify login/signup functionality
- [ ] **Recording Tests**: Test video/audio recording capabilities
- [ ] **AI Tests**: Verify emotion recognition and feedback systems

### Documentation Creation ⏳
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md for new repository
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create setup and installation guides
- [ ] Add architecture documentation
- [ ] Include user guides and tutorials
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines

### CI/CD Setup ⏳
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Set up automated testing
- [ ] Configure deployment pipelines
- [ ] Set up environment-specific deployments
- [ ] Add code quality checks

### Deployment Configuration ⏳
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Configure production deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup systems
- [ ] Set up domain and SSL certificates

### Post-Migration Cleanup ⏳
- [ ] **Remove** interview simulator code from netflix-gpt repository
- [ ] **Clean up** unused dependencies in netflix-gpt
- [ ] **Update** netflix-gpt README to remove interview references
- [ ] **Test** that netflix-gpt functionality still works
- [ ] **Document** the migration in commit messages

### Quality Assurance ⏳
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure code quality in both repositories
- [ ] **Security Review**: Verify security configurations
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Test application performance
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing**: Verify user experience
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Test system under load

## Quick Start Commands for Migration

### When Interview Code Exists - Search Commands
```bash
# Find all interview-related files
find . -name "*interview*" -o -name "*Interview*" -o -name "*job*" -o -name "*Job*"

# Search for interview content in files
grep -r -i "interview\|job.*simulator\|ai.*coach" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Check file dependencies
grep -r "import.*interview\|from.*interview" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### Repository Creation Commands
```bash
# Clone the template structure
git clone https://github.com/your-org/job-interview-simulator.git
cd job-interview-simulator

# Initialize with proper structure
mkdir -p frontend/src/{components,pages,hooks,services,context,utils}
mkdir -p backend/src/main/java/com/interviewsimulator/{controller,service,repository,model,dto,config,security}
mkdir -p docs scripts .github/workflows
```

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Copy files with history (if needed)
git subtree push --prefix=src/interview-components origin interview-feature

# Update package.json name
sed -i 's/"netflix-gpt"/"job-interview-simulator-frontend"/' package.json

# Update import paths
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -exec sed -i 's/netflix-gpt/interview-simulator/g' {} \;
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Current repository has no interview code to migrate
- Documentation is comprehensive and ready
- Templates are complete and tested
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Future migration will require careful dependency management
- Shared utilities may need duplication
- Environment configuration needs attention
- Testing will require comprehensive coverage

### High Risk ❌
- Complex interdependencies between projects would require careful separation
- Database migration could be complex if shared collections exist
- Authentication systems may need reconfiguration
- Deployment pipelines would need complete setup

## Success Criteria

### Migration Success ✅
- [ ] New repository functions independently
- [ ] All features work without netflix-gpt dependencies
- [ ] No broken functionality in either repository
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation exists
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines are operational
- [ ] Applications are successfully deployed

### Quality Metrics ✅
- [ ] Build success rate: 100%
- [ ] Test coverage: >80%
- [ ] Code quality: No critical issues
- [ ] Performance: Meets requirements
- [ ] Security: No vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation: Complete and accurate
